# Sales Intel — Strategic Intelligence Platform

## Overview

Sales Intel is an AI-powered strategic intelligence dashboard designed for aviation fuel sales teams. Sales Intel transforms raw data into actionable sales intelligence by combining external market research with internal business data.

The platform automates the research and analysis process that traditionally requires hours of manual work, delivering comprehensive customer intelligence reports in minutes.

## What Sales Intel Does

Sales Intel answers one critical question for every customer engagement: **What do we need to know about this company to win their business?**

It does this through three specialized AI agents that run in sequence, with each result appearing on screen as soon as it's ready — so you can start reading while the next agent works.

### 1. Data Analysis Agent (fastest — appears first)
Pulls and interprets internal business data from Snowflake, including:
- 12-month fuel volume and gross profit trends
- Addressable market capture rates
- Top airport locations not yet won
- Non-home-region flight activity (expansion opportunities)
- Aircraft fleet composition (tails and types)
- Credit and payment history

### 2. Market Research Agent (runs second)
Conducts real-time web research on any company using Perplexity AI, then synthesizes findings into a single executive report covering:
- Company overview, mission, and industry classification
- Competitive positioning and market share
- Financial performance and business model
- Sustainability commitments, carbon reduction goals, and SAF strategy
- ESG regulatory exposure and executive leadership stance
- Strategic opportunities for aviation fuel and services

### 3. Strategy Agent (runs last)
Synthesizes research and data into a ready-to-use strategic package:
- CRM-ready account summary fields
- Recommended sales approach and talking points
- Risk factors and opportunity areas
- Competitive positioning strategy

## Capabilities

### Existing Account Analysis
For companies already in the system, Sales Intel displays 12 key performance metrics at a glance and then runs all three agents progressively — each result appears as soon as it's ready, so you can start reading immediately.

### New Prospect Research
For companies not yet in the system, Sales Intel runs the same three agents in sequence. The Data Analysis agent infers operational context from public data, while the Research agent conducts full external research.

### Report Export
Every analysis can be exported as a professionally formatted PDF report with:
- Company branding and Sales Intel header
- All metric summaries (existing accounts)
- Full agent analysis sections
- Royal blue themed layout
